You can't change a bead once it's on (immutable), but you can make a new bracelet. It is primarily used for storing text data.\n\n3. Example:\nname = 'Python'\nprint(name[0]) # Output: P"

While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However, certain terms, such as \"is\", \"of\", and \"that\", may appear a lot but have little importance. IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it).\n\n3.
